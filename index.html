		<h2>Alyssa Walker</h2>
		<p>I am a Computer Science Major and my passions 
		include listening to music and writing poetry. Two words
		I'd use to describe myself are shy and expressive. Web development
		is an interesting course of study as it teaches how to be innovative 
		and creative while using the ever changing web. It provides essential
		knowledge which is useful for navigating the web both recreationally
		and commerically.  </p>
